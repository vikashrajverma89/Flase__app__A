    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming structure that enables developers to create and manipulate objects within a program. It is commonly used for developing applications and systems that are both maintainable and extensible, making it a popular choice for large-scale software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four pillars of OOPs are based on the four pillars of programming: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Each pillar provides a different function and helps developers organize their code for better management.\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstraction is a form of simplification and organization, allowing developers to focus on the essential parts of their code without focusing on the implementation details. It helps developers create code in a more efficient manner, while still providing the same functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is the process of combining data and codes into a single unit. It helps keep code organized, as well as helps prevent accidental data manipulation and changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is the process of creating new classes based on an existing class. It allows the developer to create subclasses that will inherit the attributes and behaviors of the parent class. This makes it easy to reuse code, making development faster and more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally here in the Four pillars of OOPs, polymorphism is a form of abstraction that allows different classes to fulfill the same behavior. By taking advantage of polymorphism, developers can create code that is more easily maintained and more versatile."
